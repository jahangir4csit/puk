                  <h3>Lighting design according to PUK</h3>
                  <p>
                    Useful. Fast. Problem-solver. This is our consulting service that allows you to choose the most suitable <br>
                    lighting solution, not only on the basis of technical documentation but also thanks to the most <br>
                    advanced rendering systems available today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The quality of our lighting design is the result of a technical-scientific approach that also takes into <br>
                    account ever-changing and unavoidable elements such as the environmental and architectural context, <br>
                    style and design, industry and type of business, current regulations regarding safety, the comfort of <br>
                    human visual perception, the psychological/communication effect to be obtained as well as the <br>
                    enhancement of some details.

                  <h3>Step by step, towards the solution</h3>
                  <p>
                    Lighting design is a complex activity which requires a rigorous and all-round consulting service: nothing <br>
                    must be left to chance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Puk team defines the criteria for drafting the lighting design. <br>
                    These are the phases that lead from the scrupulous analysis of needs to the solution and <br>
                    implementation of the system:
