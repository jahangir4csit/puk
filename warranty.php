                    Resistance to chemical and atmospherica gents.Before painting,
                    all PUK products undergo a chromic passivation treatment using 
                    trivalent chromium.</p>

                   <p> This cycle allows to favor the anchoring of the next layer of paint, 
                    to greatly improve the corrosion resistance and to preserve the 
                    electrical properties of the part.</p>

                    <p>Subsequently, epoxy primers and anticorrosive primers are 
                    applied to the part, to increase its resistance to chemicals and 
                    give excellent paint adhesion and corrosion protection properties.</p>

                      The final coating is made 
                      with powder coating, 
                      which is better than liquid 
                      paint in terms of hardness.

                      The components are 
                      coated with thermosetting 
                      powder based on synthetic 
                      resins (epoxy powder as a 
                      first base coat and 
                      polyester as a finish), 
                      which adheres by electrostatic effect, 
                      and then passed 
                      into an oven where, thanks 
                      to the temperature of 200 
                      degrees, the paint first
                      melts and then it cures to 
                      form an adherent layer.

                    The preparation process for 
                    painting takes place in 
                    multiple stages designed 
                    for the best resistance of 
                    die-cast aluminum to 
                    atmospheric agents.
                    The innovative treatment

                    nanotechnological 
                    compounds allows to 
                    increase the resistance to 
                    humidity and corrosion by 
                    aggressive, chemical and
